# SPOT – Sensor-based Predictive Operation Tracker  

## 🔍 Overview  
The way we maintain industrial machines is broken — slow, costly, and reactive.  
**SPOT (Sensor-based Predictive Operation Tracker)** is an **AI-powered IoT system** that gives CNC machines a *sixth sense*.  

By sensing **temperature, vibration, sound, and position**, and applying **machine learning**, SPOT predicts failures before they occur, transforming reactive maintenance into **proactive precision**.

## ⚡ Key Features  
- Real-time monitoring of CNC parameters  
- Machine learning (Random Forest) based fault prediction  
- IoT integration with **ThinkSpeak** for live tracking  
- MATLAB-based waveform analysis and ML console output  
- Reduces downtime & maintenance costs
